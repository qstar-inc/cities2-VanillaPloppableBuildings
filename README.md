## DISCLAIMER
> This mod requires [Asset Packs Manager](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/78903/Windows) which is highly experimental.
This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that requires this without the dependency will pop up errors.
Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save.
But either way YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage.
Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.
